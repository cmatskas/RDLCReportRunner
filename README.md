RDLCReportRunner
================

A simple RDLC report runner library. A handy little tool to own if you ever want to create pdf files on the fly on your application.
Unless you want to hand roll your pdf object using some of the open source or paid for 3rd party libraries, the easiest way to create
a pdf document is to use and RDLC report.

I know, I know, RDLC sucks, it is old and ugly. But it is free and easy to use once you get the hang of it. The designer is bad (kinda
like an Access Form) and there are not many options, but it can get the job done.

So how do you use the RDLCReportRunner class?
